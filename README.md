# Web Dev 2 Project
This is the final Web Development 2 project.

We we're tasked to recreate the site Food Explorer as accurately as possible. 

Our group consists of Nick Birkus, Albert Liu, and Joaquin Opulencia.

We ran into some issues in both the construction of the website and the utilization of git as well as communication issues with merging and resolving conflicts which we are sure is very common place in collaborative development projects. We learned a lot from this experience and will apply these learnings in future projects moving forward. 

Thank you to Josh Solomon for instructing Web Dev 2 to us.
